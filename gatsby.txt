Gatsby believed in the green light. He had a raging clue for Daisy, who represented the American Dream.

Gatsby and Nick also had a very, very special relationship. In fact, Tumblr itself was born from the
yaoi borne from Gatsby and Nick's interactions.

Fortunately, Tumblr will soon disappear from the face of the internet! Muah ha ha?
