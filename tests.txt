Test Case:
If a match is found, and its edited, what happens if an error is introduced
from an earlier expression? Presumably, it skips and only after evaluation
by strunk a second time is it caught.
Alternatively, introduce an unlimited mode to strunk as an option, parse until
0 errors for some finite time.
