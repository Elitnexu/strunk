# Strunk

Strunk is a command-line tool for parsing text documents written in Python.

It takes in a user-defined regular expression ruleset in the form of a
.strunk file and checks a given text document for matches with the rules
provided. For each match found, the user is given the choice to edit the
matching sentence in the text and save any changes made.

Strunk is named after [William Strunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Strunk_Jr.),
author of [The Elements of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style).
